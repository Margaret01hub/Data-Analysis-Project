#DANO AIRLINE PASSENGER SATISFACTION ANALYSIS
##Background and Problem Statement
Dano Airline conducted a passenger survey, and for the first time, passengers’ satisfaction rate fell below 50%. This project analyses the reason for a 57% dissatisfaction rate among the passengers, with satisfaction rate now at 43%. This shows that a majority of the passengers are dissatisfied with the airline, which could be as a result of operations or service issues. The survey had a total of 130,000 respondent (passengers), and shows an average arrival and departure delay time of 15minutes, and an average service rating of 3.24/5. Solutions are required to improve passengers’ experience, thereby increasing satisfaction.
